4. Dates
===========

1. Check that Dates section has titles “Received:”, “Accepted:”, “Published:” (start with capital letter and followed by colon (“:”))

2. Check that month is spelled out as a word and dates are in-line with the following format: Month Day, Year
(e.g. June 01, 2017, April 12, 2016, December 31, 2015, etc.)

3. Check spelling of the month

4. Check that Received date is older than Accepted date, and Accepted date is older than Published date (i.e. we cannot publish before we accept, and cannot accept before we receive).

Pay attention to years.
