Assign to vendor
================

| ***Role: Production manager***

| The Assign to vendor task (system [ID] 117) open automatically when an
  accepted paper is imported from the submission system. During this
  task, the production manager reviews the originally submitted
  manuscript to collect and act upon the following information:
  
 - Whether the manuscript was assigned to the correct section
 - Whether a fee waiver or any English editing fees may apply
 - What type of license/author agreement document should be sent to the authors
 - Whether the manuscript section places any restrictions on which vendor it may be assigned to
  
| The production editor then records the results of their inquiry using
  the designated system functions and assigns the manuscript to the
  composition vendor. Before completing the task, the production editor
  has an option to add special instructions to the composition vendor.
  Three tasks open automatically upon completion of the assign to vendor
  task: `Awaiting license to publish <#awaiting-license-to-publish>`__,
  `Awaiting payment <#awaiting-payment>`__, and
  `Composition <#composition>`__.
