Ready for archving
===================

**Role:** `Vendor <roles.html#vendor>`__

This is the final task in the current implementation of the workflow.

During this task, JPS notifies the vendor that the article is ready
for pre-issue archiving. The vendor packages the article files into an
archive and uploads it to the JPS FTP.
Upload directory: /home/JPS/To_JPS

The archive file should be names as follows: OT_[MS#]_VoR.zip
Note: VoR stands for version of record.
Once the archive has been imported, JPS will notify the Production
Manager that the article has been archived and is ready to be included
in the issue.
