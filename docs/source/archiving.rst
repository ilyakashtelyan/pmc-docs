Ready for archving
===================

| Role: Vendor
| This is the final task in the current implementation of the workflow.
  During this task, JPS notifies the vendor that the article is ready
  for pre-issue archiving. The vendor packages the article files into an
  archive and uploads it to the JPS FTP.
| Upload directory: /home/JPS/To_JPS
| The archive file should be names as follows: OT_[MS#]_VoR.zip
| Note: VoR stands for version of record.
| Once the archive has been important, JPS will notify the Production
  Manager that the article has been archived and is ready to be included
  in the issue.
