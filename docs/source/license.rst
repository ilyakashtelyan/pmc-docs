Awaiting license to publish
===========================

| *Roles: `Records office <roles.html#records-office>`__ , `Author <roles.html#author>`__ *

| Immediately upon completion of the `Assign to vendor <assigntovendor.html>`__ task, JPS opens a query and notifies the
  authors regarding the required license to publish or author agreement
  document. The system sends scheduled reminders to the authors until
  they complete the query response. When this happens, the system notifies the records office staff that a document
  was submitted and asks them to review it. The records office staff
  reviews the document and either initiates a new round of the the Awaiting license to publish task if the provided document is not suitable, or records the
  status of the form as received and completes the task. 
  
 .. warning: this task blocks the `ePub in OJS <epub.html>`__ task: it wonâ€™t open until this task is complete.
