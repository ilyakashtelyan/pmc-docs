Awaiting license to publish
===========================

| *Roles: Record office, Author*

| Immediately upon completion of the `Assign to vendor <#assign-to-vendor>`__ task, JPS opens a query and notifies the
  authors regarding the required license to publish or author agreement
  document. The system sends scheduled reminders to the authors until
  the complete the query response. Upon completion of the query
  response, the system notifies the Forms Office staff that a document
  was submitted and asks them to review it. The Forms Office staff
  reviews the document and either reinitiates the Awaiting license to publish task if the provided document is not suitable, or records the
  status of the form as received and completes the task. Note that this
  task blocks the `ePub in OJS <#epub-in-ojs>`__ task: it wonâ€™t open
  until this task is complete.
