JPS Documentation
=========================================

Welcome to the Impact Journals JPS documentation site!
|The purpose of this site is to provide instructions for the workflow implemented in Impact Journals JPS as of October 2017. 
The complete table of contents can be found below. 
|For new users, we suggest starting by reviwing the general workflow diagram, as well as the the intro and roles pages.

| The tasks described here are organized in the
  same order as they are encountered in the workflow to the maximum
  extent possible. Please keep in mind that some tasks or task chains
  may run in parallel. Please refer to the workflow diagram for further
  information.

.. important:: This is not a specific guide for each task. Instead, this
  document should give you a general idea of how the tasks are arranged
  and whatâ€™s the overall purpose of each task, as well as serve as a
  point of reference for the various naming conventions used throughout
  the system. For specific instructions associated with each task, please refer to
  the linked videos.
