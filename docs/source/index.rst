JPS Documentation
=========================================

Welcome to the Impact Journals JPS documentation site!
Here, you will find the instructions for the workflow implemented in Impact Journals JPS as of October 2017. 

For new users, we suggest starting by reviwing the general workflow diagram, as well as the the `intro <intro.html>`__ and `roles <roles.html>`__ pages before proceeding with the rest of the docs.

The tasks described here are organized in the
same order as they are encountered in the workflow to the maximum
extent possible. Please keep in mind that some tasks or task chains
may run in parallel. Please refer to the workflow diagram for further
information.

.. important:: Specific task instructions can be found in the embedded videos. The task pages on this site should give you a general idea of how the tasks are arranged and what’s the overall purpose of each task, as well as serve as a point of reference for the various naming conventions used in the system.
