JPS Documentation
=========================================

Welcome to the Impact Journals JPS documentation site!
Here, you will find the instructions for the workflow implemented in Impact Journals JPS as of October 2017. 

For new users, we suggest starting by reviwing the general workflow diagram, as well as the the intro and roles pages.

The tasks described here are organized in the
same order as they are encountered in the workflow to the maximum
extent possible. Please keep in mind that some tasks or task chains
may run in parallel. Please refer to the workflow diagram for further
information.

.. important:: This is not a specific guide for each task. Instead, this
document should give you a general idea of how the tasks are arranged and whatâ€™s the overall purpose of each task, as well as serve as a 
point of reference for the various naming conventions used throughout
the system. For specific instructions associated with each task, please refer to
the linked videos.
