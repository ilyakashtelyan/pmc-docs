JPS Documentation
=========================================

Welcome to the Impact Journals JPS documentation site!
|The purpose of this site is to provide instructions for the workflow implemented in Impact Journals JPS as of October 2017. 
The complete table of contents can be found below. 
|For new users, we suggest starting by reviwing the general workflow diagram, as well as the the intro and roles pages.

.. note:: This site covers all of the tasks currently included in the workflow. You will likely be responsible for only a few of these tasks. Please see the `roles <roles.html>`__ page for the list of the tasks associated with your role.
