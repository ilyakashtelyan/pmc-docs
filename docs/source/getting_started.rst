Getting started
===============

Welcome to the PMC corrections documentation!

In this document we separate articles into two big groups:

1. All papers (except Editorials and News)
2. Editorials and News

The scope of checks varies greatly between these two groups. And therefore, it is important to know which group you are dealing with when you are reviewing the article.

Below we will show you how to know to which group the article in questions belongs:

1. Get to the article page (either replace pii in the URL of currently opened article or use search)

2. Take a look at TOC Section Title (see screenshot below). 

- If you see there "News" or "Editorials", then go here to check review instructions.

- If you see there something else (NOT "News" or "Editorials"), then go here.
