Introduction
===================================

For new users, we suggest starting by reviwing the `workflow diagram `workflow diagram <_static/JPS_workflow_diagram.pdf>`__, as well as the the `intorudctory video <#video-jps-intro>`__ and the `roles <roles.html>`__ page before proceeding with the rest of the docs.

The `workflow diagram <_static/JPS_workflow_diagram.pdf>`__ presents the complete picture of a paper's lifecycle, the video provides a quick overview of the key concepts that JPS is built around, and the roles page presents a list of tasks assigned to each role.

.. important:: This site covers all of the tasks currently included in the workflow. You will likely be responsible for only a few of these tasks. Please see the `roles <roles.html>`__ page for the list of the tasks associated with your role.
