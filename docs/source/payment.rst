Awaiting payment
================

**Roles:** `Payment office <roles.html#payment-office>`__ , `Author <roles.html#author>`__

Awaiting payment is a multi-step task that runs in parallel with the
rest of the workflow. This task opens when the `Assign to vendor <assigntovendor.html>`__ task is completed and involves
generating the initial invoice, adjusting it per authorsâ€™
requirements, recording payments (manually for checks, wire transfers,
and ACH, automatically for credit cards), and providing receipts and
paid invoice documents.
