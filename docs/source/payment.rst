Awaiting payment
================

| *Roles: Payment office, Authors*

| Awaiting payment is a multi-step task that runs in parallel with the
  rest of the workflow. This task opens when the `Assign to vendor <assigntovendor.html>`__ task is completed and involves
  generating the initial invoice, adjusting it per authors’
  requirements, recording payments (manually for checks, wire transfers,
  and ACH, automatically for credit cards), and providing receipts and
  paid invoice documents.
