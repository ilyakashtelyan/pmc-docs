ePub in OJS
===========

| Role: Vendor
| As a reminder, this task can only open if the Awaiting license to
  publish task is complete. During this task, the vendor will prepare
  the article files for publication in OJS (“on the website”). This
  process requires that the vendor review and implement any changes
  requested by the authors during the Author proof review task. It also
  requires that the vendor prepare the publication-ready PDF, HTML, and
  any supplementary files and upload them to OJS. The vendor will also
  enter the article metadata and provide the HTML code for the front
  matter of the article. Overall, the steps that the vendor must take
  during this task outside of JPS are the standard steps required for
  article publication under the old workflow.
| Once the vendor has published the article in OJS, they also must mark
  this task as complete in JPS. During this process, they will be
  required to enter and verify the PII number assigned to the article by
  OJS, as well as the total page count for the PDF version of the
  article.
| Note: please do not include supplementary file page counts in the
  total!
| During this task, the vendor has an option to open a query to the
  authors via the Send email interface.

ePub in Paperchase
==================

| Role: Production manager
| This task opens immediately after the ePub in OJS task is completed.
  It is assigned to the production manager and requires publishing the
  article to the Advance page and entering the date published into OJS.
  Once this task is complete, the system will notify the authors that
  their article is published online and provide them with the link to
  it. The Post-publication check group of tasks begins immediately after
  this step.
