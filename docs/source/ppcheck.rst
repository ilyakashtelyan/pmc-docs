Post-publication check
=====================

| The post-publication check is a group of tasks that are arranged
  together to achieve the goal of identifying post-publications
  (commonly referred to as PubMed) corrections to the article,
  communicating them to the vendor, implementing the identified
  corrections and verifying the implementation.

Assign post-publication check to PE
-----------------------------------

Role: *`Production editor manager <roles.html#production-editor-manager>`__

| During this step, the PE manager assigns the published articles to
  individual production editors who will guide it through the
  post-publication check process.

Post-publication check (round 1)
--------------------------------

| Role: *`Production editor <roles.html#production-editor>`__

| This task opens when the article is assigned to a production editor.
  During this task, the PE navigates to the article and checks it
  against the predetermined set of standards. The PE then identifies any
  required corrections and relays them to the vendor. Alternatively, the
  PE may mark the article as ready for archiving right away if they do
  not detect any required corrections. Doing so will immediately
  complete the post-publication check process and open the `ready for
  archiving <archiving.html>`__ task.
| During this step, the PE also has an option to contact the authors by
  opening a query via the Send email function.

Vendor revisions required
-------------------------

| Role: *`Vendor <roles.html#vendor>`__

| This task opens if the PE identifies any required corrections during
  the post-publication check task. During this task, the vendor performs
  the requested corrections and notified the PE that they are completed.

Post-publication check (round 2)
--------------------------------

| Role: *Production Editor <roles.html#production-editor>`__

| After the vendor indicates that theyâ€™ve completed the requested
  corrections, it is up to the PE to review the published article again
  and to indicate if further corrections are required. This can be
  accomplished in the same way as the initial post-publication check:
  the PE is presented with two options, one of which returns the article
  to the vendor for further corrections and the other one complete the
  post-publication check process and opens the ready for archiving task.
