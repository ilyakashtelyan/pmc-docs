Post-publication check
=====================

The post-publication check is a group of tasks that are arranged
together to achieve the goal of identifying post-publication
(commonly referred to as PubMed) corrections to the article,
communicating them to the vendor, implementing the identified
corrections and verifying the implementation.

Assign post-publication check to PE
-----------------------------------

**Role:** `Production editor manager <roles.html#production-editor-manager>`__

During this step, the PE manager assigns the published articles to
individual production editors who will guide it through the
post-publication check process.

Post-publication check (round 1)
--------------------------------

**Role:** `Production editor <roles.html#production-editor>`__

This task opens when the article is assigned to a production editor.
During this task, the PE navigates to the article and checks it
against the predetermined set of standards. The PE then identifies any
required corrections and relays them to the vendor. Alternatively, the
PE may mark the article as ready for archiving right away if they do
not detect any required corrections. Doing so will immediately
complete the post-publication check process and open the `ready for
archiving <archiving.html>`__ task.

During this step, the PE also has an option to contact the authors by
opening a query via the Send email function.

Video: Post-publication check: contacting authors,recording response, and relaying additional corrections to vendors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the post-pub check process, the PEs have an option to request additional materials and ask questions to the authors. This is done using the Send email functionality and is described in the corresponding video.
A special scenario is possible when the PE has corrections for the vendors to implement right away, but also needs to contact the authors. There are a couple ways to accommodate this situation.

1) If you have corrections for the vendors but also need to contact the authors:

 - Contact the authors using the Send email functionality. Please choose the 'Question' template.
 - Send th remaining corrections to the composition vendor as usual.
 - If the authors respond before the vendor has marked the preivously sent corrections as complete, use the Send email functionality to forward additional corrections to them. Please use the Additional corrections necessary template.

2) If you do not have any corrections to relay to the vendor but still need a response from the authors:

 - Contact the authors using the Send email functionality. Please choose the 'Question' template.
 - Do not use the Revisions required or No corrections options yet! Raising a query to the authors will put the post-publication task check on hold automatically. 
 - As soon as you receive a response from the authors, please request corrections as usual.

.. warning:: If you do not have any actual corrections to request, please _do not send an empty "placeholder" email_ to the vendor! This includes emails indicating that you are waiting for something from the authors. Please only use the 'revisions required' option if you are requesting actual corrections!

Vendor revisions required
-------------------------

**Role:** `Vendor <roles.html#vendor>`__

This task opens if the PE identifies any required corrections during
the post-publication check task. During this task, the vendor performs
the requested corrections and notifies the PE that they are completed.

Post-publication check (round 2)
--------------------------------

**Role:** `Production editor <roles.html#production-editor>`__

After the vendor indicates that theyâ€™ve completed the requested
corrections, the PE will review the published article again and indicate if further corrections are required. This can be accomplished in the same way as the initial post-publication check. The PE is presented with two options: one returns the article to the vendor for further corrections, and the other completes the post-publication check process and opens the ready for archiving task.
